Would like to eventually at least have a model with a 48MP sensor since I don\u2019t right now. But no rush right now since I haven\u2019t been taking very many photos/videos the past few years, overall. \n\nDefinitely want a 6.7\u201d model but would rather splurge on the 15 Pro Max than the 15 Plus since the Plus is still expensive especially if you get a higher storage and it\u2019s missing a lot of benefits of the Pro Max which isn\u2019t really the much more.   They\u2019re both over $1000 in the end. lol \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI just feel like I should go for the Pro Max. I def can\u2019t do smaller size anymore. Too used to having a 6.7\u201d, and watch a lot of video, and play games. Sooo. The A17 Pro chip also kicks it up a notch for mobile gaming! Which I think is nice. \n\nAll that said, I\u2019m not upgrading yet. But maybe early next year. No rush. \n\nBesides, I\u2019ve friends who preordered the 15 Pro Max and shipping is already pushing to the end of November for some! About 2 months!!\n\nSo I probably couldn\u2019t even get one now until Xmas! lol \ud83d\ude02",

                "text": "I just recently switched from a Pixel 7 to a 14 Pro (mainly for work), and I can\u2019t tell you how many times I was told/recommended to wait for the 15 models. Truth be told, I really like the 14 Pro and just wanted something with a 120hz display, all-day battery, wireless charging, and a reliable modem. I was also able to get a great deal with a $700 trade in credit thanks to a promo, which wouldn\u2019t have been the case had I waited. Now I\u2019ll start off by saying I\u2019m not necessarily partial to android or iOS, in fact I\u2019ve jumped back & forth between the two over the years. Mainly to experience the pros of both, but also to keep myself familiarized with the current state of the two. That being said, I\u2019m genuinely surprised that iOS 16.5.1 (the version my 14 Pro had out of the box & I am still currently using) is more customizable than Android 13 (or 14, for that matter). At least in terms of the lock screen/total widget support. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve used iOS (the XR was my last iPhone), but I\u2019ve gotta admit that I\u2019m fairly impressed with how much control Apple has finally given the end user when it comes to the UI. Of course Android still has the wallpaper-based color schemes that can be implemented system wide, although there were times that I had issues getting the correct color combo to apply with my Pixel 7. Anyway, aesthetics aside the 14 Pro has been an upgrade in quite a few ways, namely the screen & biometrics. The wireless modem was honestly one of the biggest factors for me; for whatever reason my Pixel 7 just had terrible reception often whereas the 14 Pro has yet to have a single issue in all of the same areas I frequent. It also hardly ever gets warm outside of fast charging, even despite the fact that I live in the southern US (TX). Which leads me to another point. Pixels are revered to have some of the best cameras a smartphone can have. This is not an exaggeration, the hardware + software combo implemented by Google is indeed impressive. However, this is only true for still images/photographs. With video recording, it\u2019s a bit of a mess. I\u2019m not a pro photographer by any means, but I do enjoy capturing special moments (mostly involving my kids or friends & family). And when I was recording a school event my daughter was involved in, the Pixel 7 stopped abruptly after 20 min due to \u201cgetting too hot\u201d (and this was just at 1080p/60fps). While yes, I do live in a region with a reputation for being overly hot most of the year, this was back  in early Spring & I was also indoors. I\u2019ve never had another smartphone EVER cease video recording due to something like that. Needless to say, it was really disappointing. The biometrics were also very\u2026\u201dsloppy\u201d. The in-screen fingerprint reader was hit or miss basically all the time, especially if my thumb was too dry or too wet/moist. The face unlock had about the same success rate. So more often than not I had to resort to drawing my pattern unlock to get past the lock screen. Not the worst thing ever, but certainly a mild inconvenience for a phone that\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cflagship\u201d (or at the very least is priced like one). Aside from those qualms though, it wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call a \u201cterrible\u201d experience. Google just needs to step up their game some more. They did great with bringing a true \u201cpremium\u201d feel to the Pixel line with the redesign of the 6 & 6 Pro. But the actual experience is still lacking, and one could argue that it\u2019s possibly just \u201cgrowing pains\u201d from switching to a new/custom SoC, though I digress. The Pixel is more suitable for those who prefer to tinker and tweak their phone in whatever ways they want (or favor versatility), while iPhones are arguably more refined and just \u201cwork\u201d in all the ways you need a smartphone to \u2014 on the spot, without any issues. You sacrifice a bit of \u201cfreedom\u201d, but in exchange you have more reliability overall and don\u2019t have to worry about running into problems when it comes to what\u2019s important to you (whether that be photography, communication, etc). I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never had a preference for either android or iOS; to me smartphones are just tools that are intended to make life easier or just help you get certain things done. The last thing I\u2019ll say is that I do hope Google improves the non-Pro Pixels moving forward; the base model should at the very least offer more as to set it apart from the \u201cA\u201d series (which was hardly the case with the 7 & 7a, for most people they might as well be the same phone). Perhaps I\u2019ll revisit the Pixel when the 9 or 10 series comes out, hopefully by then they will truly be the \u201ciPhone\u201d of the android world.",

I am 53 so don\u2019t care about status of any kind as the Apple products are beautiful and always scream rich looking to me but my Samsung does things that my iPhone can\u2019t begin to do ! Sadly! But half my fam is on Samsung android and  my daughter is on Apple so of course messaging my daughter is great and as she\u2019s going to have a child soon I love FaceTime in the messages. I love everything about iMessages but when I\u2019m on a Samsung phone, I can do kind of the same thing with other people that are on Samsung the only time I feel like I\u2019m missing out is when I am corresponding with my daughter who has an iPhone ! Now I am debating after having an iPhone 13 for a couple years now and because of its brightness is sound nothing is that great to me? As a matter fact I think it\u2019s one of the worst Apple phones ever that I have used iPhone I should say sorry Apple fans, it did bare minimum of anything that I wanted it to do I knew that going in I thought as I\u2019m older it won\u2019t make too much of a difference boy was I wrong 120 Hz was missed especially coming from android but again that is not why I really mess with that iPhone it\u2019s because iMessages as I said before Texting does seem to be a bit more polished than an android well Samsung is the only one I can speak for personally and yes I have downloaded the Gboard app of course, with that all being said, I\u2019m not locked into either Eco system as I do not have a computer, I have a tablet from Samsung. I have an iPad from Apple, I like them both equally I mainly use them for writing notes and watching content. I find myself bored with an iPhone where is with android Samsung. I can do almost anything I want if I dig deep enough and learn how customization is still important because it gives me what I want if I\u2019m gonna pay for something and a lot of money I want it to do what I want it to do not what it thinks I should do, I\u2019m one of those that like to tinker and dig but I would never consider myself a techie just someone who likes to have fun with it but now I\u2019m stuck between with a grandbaby coming do I just keep my iPad so I can still do FaceTime and then get an android phone so that I can Write my notes where I\u2019m at when I need them the most with the ultra that has a pen included or do I stick with iPhone new to FaceTime in iMessages all the time? Perhaps I\u2019ve gotten myself into a pickle half my family hates Apple the other half hates Samsung. I will never understand as long as I live why somebody would be loyal to a brand that does not pay you to be loyal to them. I\u2019ve never been that way about anything myself Pay for what I like what I enjoy at that time I don\u2019t care who\u2019s name is on it and so I\u2019m not the one to be in the war I think both offer wonderful things and of course they don\u2019t offer the same exact things then they wouldn\u2019t have competition I think what truly keeps iPhone alive for most is iMessages And because of that, they can go as high as they want, and people will pay for that convenience that polished Ness, and it is absolutely fantastic. Without a doubt other than that I do not like being in the fenced garden I have a mind of my own and love to get out and do what I want where I want with who I want with what I want that anytime I want, I get it better security if you can\u2019t do as much or goes far or choose what you wanna do and I can embrace that and appreciate that but there are other things that I can get to protect me an android so that is not a game changer by any means Hell of a 12 year old or perhaps it was a 13 year old can get into Apple\u2018s system and hack it. How secure is it truly in my heart and so I would say about as much as anything else truly anything can be hacked any system Chan crash. Do you teches out there? Have any ideas what I can do or what I should do as I\u2019m curious to your thoughts as As they may help me along the  process? I believe I can use FaceTime on Wi-Fi from any of my Apple products to keep in touch with my daughter and my grandbaby to be and still enjoy the android as my phone. I think we can even do FaceTime from android now as long as somebody from iPhone sends the link I\u2019m sure it\u2019s probably not as good but hopefully doable anybody out there doing that as well if so, tell me how that\u2019s working out. I love to take pictures but I\u2019m not a photographer and this whole slow shutter button on android is a real bummer so I am waiting for the S 24 ultra and hoping it has been upgraded in that area before I make a final decision. I\u2019m glad that iPhone is brighter. Now, as I am older, things are becoming harder to see harder to hear And so on and so forth they\u2019re both so great it is so hard my iPhone 13 is the first time I got a non-flagship phone from Apple. I just could never do that again although most things didn\u2019t bother me about it the few things that it didn\u2019t have bothered me the most, perhaps I should\u2019ve gone with the promax as I wanted to but I\u2019m having wrist issues to hold something extremely heavy now that\u2019s gone away for the most part. It is no longer an issue for those of you that love both I know I\u2019m not alone help help help lol, I\u2019m never a hater towards any brand I was even looking into the new Google pixel as I love the voice dictation it is on point for sure and that\u2019s important for somebody like me who\u2019s getting older who wants to use notes or record somebody or whatever it may be even talk out a text or all these phones seem to offer some thing that something else doesn\u2019t I guess that\u2019s what keeps them all in business now it\u2019s time I start looking for a computer and this is where I\u2019m deciding. What ecosystem do I want to be in for that kind of changes the game, it kind of keeps me locked in which I hate, but you got to take the bad with a great",

It's well known that android batteries barely get through a year before the battery has noticeably degraded to the point you're having to charge multiple times per day, or turn on energy saving mode. iPhones typically last 2 years with normal usage until the same happens.\n\nWhy moan about lack of fast charging, when regular users will only be charging every day or two, and will be doing so overnight? There's also the fact that Apple literally have a magsafe battery you can put on the back and just stick it in your pocket, taking away the worry of finding a wall wart and cable.\n\nIdk, fast charging just isn't an issue to me. I do accept there are others who are different though, like the people who go to work and spend their entire day not actually working, but acting like a call center for \"microsoft tech support\", who's phones are dead before the day has even begun \ud83d\ude02",

Whereas multi tasking, pinch zoom in out, pop out applications and many other features such as two apps at same time  could have been added to make this phone good for productivity but Apple doesn't want to do, its just encashing two segments 1) rich, elite section and 2) those who doesn't need, doesn't have moneh but want to show off , 3) this section is the real use of iphone who buts because they like something in iphone that feature is must for them or they want to be in the ecosystem of Apple so they buy it to maintaining smoothness in their respective work",

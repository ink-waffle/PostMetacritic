This scene in particular was amazing in a previous movie:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0P7R9CfCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0P7R9CfCY)\n\nSome of the scientists doing testing on the new plutonium core got a little reckless in how they handled it. In the scene above, the demon core goes prompt critical (I think that's what it is called) and everyone in the room received a lot of radiation exposure. Unfortunately for Slotin (Think this is him -- there were two scientists killed by the demon core), the amount of radiation he received was fatal.\n\nAs a scientist well educated in radioactivity and the math behind exposure amounts, he knew as soon as he separated the two cores that he was a walking dead man. It must have been really depressing to realize your life was now over and you were living on borrowed time just from a few seconds of exposure from something that was extremely radioactive (and I don't use that word lightly, that thing was putting out some serious levels of radiation).\n\nIn fact, I heard stories that some of the scientists saw a lot of blue in their vision and that it was related to a type of radiation that is created when it travels through water (I forget the name for this type of radiation -- I think it starts with a K?).\n\nAnyway, looking forward to the movie!",

I am psyched for this movie and hope Nolan takes a bunch of liberties to make it more cinematic!)\n\nDuring the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer was in S-10,000, the control bunker, which was an earthern bunker with no windows. Scientists in that bunker did report seeing a bright light, but through the open back door, which was facing away from the explosion.\n\nN-10,000 was a different bunker, for cameras, which did have round windows, but Oppenheimer was not there.\n\n>Three observation points were established at 10,000 yards from ground zero. These were wooden shelters protected by concrete and earth. The south bunker served as the control center for the test. The automatic firing device was triggered from there as key men such as Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, head of Los Alamos, watched. None of the manned bunkers are left.\n\nhttps://www.atomicarchive.com/history/trinity/test.html\n\n>Groves and Oppenheimer, standing at the S-10,000 control bunker, discussed what to do if the weather did not break in time for the scheduled 4:00 a.m. test. At 3:30 they pushed the time back to 5:30; at 4:00 the rain stopped. Kistiakowsky and his team armed the device shortly after 5:00 a.m. and retreated to S-10,000. In accordance with his policy that each observe from different locations in case of an accident, Groves left Oppenheimer and joined Bush and Conant at base camp\n\nhttps://www.atomicarchive.com/history/manhattan-project/p5s5.html\n\nInterview with some present at Trinity talking about the bunkers:\nhttps://youtu.be/4rGUBKpAYuE\n\n>Joe McKibben, another scientist, said, \"We had a lot of flood lights on for taking movies of the control panel. When the bomb went off, the lights were drowned out by the big light coming in through the open door in the back.\"\n\nhttps://www.atomicarchive.com/history/trinity/test.html",

IMO Nolan did something really original..and I appreciate it. \nHe deliberately stripped away the characters and the concepts and the emotional components of the movie to showcase the *temporal pincer* as a movie. \n\nLike a r/WoahDude post, but the whole movie. It was a deliberate artistic choice and I can respect that. \n\nIn interviews he mentioned that the dialogue was merely nothing more than a sound effect, and this has been done before.\n\nWhen we go watch a \u201cdumb\u201d comedy movie just for laughs.. we don\u2019t go in expecting to get emotional satiation for it we just want the chuckles and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, similarly when we watch a deep character study, we look at some works of Daniel Day Lewis, why should a science fiction movie be any different? if it is simply looking for to stimulate a  different kind of response.\nIt\u2019s basically an indie movie with a high budget scale! \nNolan deliberately chose to reduce characters to basic cookie cutter archetypes.. the nameless action spy, the mysterious sidekick, the damsel, the typical Bond villain\u2026 simply because they function as nothing more than set dressing.\n\nYou\u2019ll have a lot of fun if you stop looking for meaningful character development, because he didn\u2019t put it there by purpose.. next time when you watch it, try to put the puzzle pieces of the timeline together and you\u2019ll have a lot of fun if that your kind of thing! \n\nNolan made Insomnia, Inception, TDK and he definitely had help, but he\u2019s not a stupid filmmaker who cannot tell if the mixing is wrong. Give him some credit :)",

If there was a very clear audio cue that meant I'm not SUPPOSED to understand it (like the talking in reverse scenes), I'd be able to grasp it a little better I think.  \n  \nAgain, I enjoyed it despite any of that - but I'm not sure that defense holds water for me.

Like of course I teared up at that scene, but given the subject matter I think you'd have to be the worst director of all time to not elicit a tear there. \n\nOne of the major themes of the movie was the timelessness of love, and I don't think that was ever really felt. Bear in mind I'm comparing him to the upper echelon of directors here when I say this (Nolan is maybe my favorite modern director), but he deserves this level of comparison because this is the pantheon he sits in. His movies have emotional moments, but his characters are always action/purpose-driven, which is where you lose the human element. \n\nBest example is the scene where McCaunahoosee finds a way to communicate with Murph through his love for her. In the hands of a different director, that is absolutely, unequivocally, the single most emotional and beautiful scene in that movie bar none. A man traverses through a place with no time, sense, or direction, guided by nothing but the bond he has with his daughter? I don't know what the peak of that scene looks like, but I should be sobbing there. In Nolan's hands it's instead a visual spectacle, which I appreciate and enjoy, but it's just a difference in priority for him. \n\nIt's a difference in taste. I don't think there's anything wrong with what Nolan did. But, like, if you gave Spielberg just that one scene and told him to just do his thing, you'd get a much different interpretation that I think I personally would have preferred.",

I think you're overestimating his characters. They're good, but they're at most the same as Nolan's. For every Schindler's list, there's like 3 weird movies that don't quite land. The only movie comparable to Interstellar is really Saving Private Ryan (action drama) and tbh, I think they're equally as good. I'd even give some more weight to Interstellar on characterization. SPR had more intense war loss moments though and handled PTSD superbly.

        "It's one of my favorite examples of filmmakers disagreeing about what a movie is about, and for the better.\n\nDirector Danny Boyle was raised Catholic, and sees the movie as a metaphor for an encounter with God. Writer Alex Garland, who is atheist, sees the movie as being about religious mania, and *thinking* you're encountering God, when you're not. \n\nI think their contradictory viewpoints enrich the movie, making it more complex and thought provoking.\n\nAnother example is *The Exorcist*. Director William Friedkin is an atheist, and directed the movie as a documentary. William Peter Blatty wrote the novel and the screenplay, was educated by priests and did very serious research on how real exorcisms are performed. \n\nSame goes for the cast. Except for the two lead priests, most of the priest characters are played by actual priests, some friends of Blatty. But Max Von Sydow, a staunch atheist, said playing the old priest was no different than playing a fairy in a Shakespeare play.",

After the Doolittle raid, in retaliation, Japan murdered roughly 250k Chinese civilians, that's more than both bombs combined.\n\nLeveling a city wasn't a matter for debate, the debate was around leveling another city. Japanese propaganda was adamant that when the Home Islands were invaded there would be no surrender, it would be a fight until extermination. The mass suicides on Okinawa and the resistance on islands like Iwo Jima, where Japanese soldiers fought on long after the last shred of hope for victory was lost seemed to reinforce the idea that this was going to be a fight to the death, there would be no Japan after the war.\n\nIn that context, nuking a couple of hundred thousand people seems almost trivial when you're mentally preparing to send in soldiers to manually kill millions while losing hundreds of thousands of your own men. Contrary to popular belief, the goal of the nukes wasn't to scare Japan into surrender. That was the hope of some people, but most of the military was gearing up to use them as tactical and strategic weapons, clearing the way for US troops to land. It was just one more tool in a very large arsenal that turns people into corpses and one that cost a very large fortune at that.\n\nSo yes, he wanted to use them. They were built to be used, they were built to kill a lot of people, because one way or another, a lot of people were going to die, so it might as well be the other guy.",

And force an *unconditional* surrender before an lingering war in the Pacific became horribly unpopular at home.  \n\nTwo: To see if it was viable. \n\nThree: (and to me this is probably the \"real\" reason).. to set off the Bomb on the world stage as a major message to our soon-to-be post war enemies (at the time Communists nations) as to the new power of the US military.  \n\nI am not sure how much Three is discussed.  But after WWII there were going to be some big power-vacuums.  And those vacuums were going to fill up quickly with either \"allies' or \"not-allies\".  And that could have near *instantly* triggered a second major world conflict.  \n\nThe bombs were clearly a giant message to the world about letting WWII end.. and then *stop*.  And while it's not the best run in the history of the planet .. large (like really large) scale wars .. have been deferred for one very important reason: Nuclear consequences.",

        "Thank god I\u2019ve found someone else in this thread with a reasonable take. You are 100% correct about the pressure Truman had to use the bomb. He was a nobody thrust into the presidency immediately after a president who was as close to a god in American politics as anyone since Washington. Not a military man. Not well-respected. Not really known by anyone. He (and Democrats at large) would have been crucified had he not used the bomb.\n\nAnd as much as I love Roosevelt, he was wildly irresponsible allowing the DNC to nominate Truman. Roosevelt was already very sick, and he basically had no input in who would be on the ticket with him. You could maybe argue that Roosevelt did this on purpose. He knew that if he died in office, a nobody like Truman would face enormous pressure to just do whatever people thought Roosevelt would do. I don\u2019t think that was the case though. My best guess is that FDR was just delusional about his health and thought he\u2019d definitely live to see the end of the war.\n\nI would just ask that everyone read the accounts of Saipan and Okinawa before they come to a conclusion on the morality of dropping the bomb. They are harrowing. People like to talk about the civilian deaths from the bomb and point to them as the reason it was so bad to drop the bomb. But read about Okinawa and Saipan, and you\u2019ll quickly realize that civilians were not spared there either. Not because the allies killed them, but because the Japanese killed each other rather than surrendering.\n\nThe anti-bomb people seem to assume the Japanese were a rational (by modern standards) people. But that was not the case. Rational people don\u2019t commit mass suicide or kill their families for a lost cause. It is tragic that it came to that point, but I am 100% convinced that it took the U.S. flexing to finally break the Japanese. \u201cWe can burn down your capital with massive air raids\u201d didn\u2019t work.

The guy center left (Harry Daghlian) and the guy center right (Louis Slotin) would be killed later by their own hubris when testing another nuclear source, the plutonium core nicknamed \"The Demon Core.\"\n\nEach of them would test how close they could get to a criticality event by (1, Daghlian) slowly lowering tungsten carbide bricks in place around the nuclear source using *his fucking hands* and (2, Slotin) slowly lowering two half spheres of beryllium over the very same nuclear source using a *fucking flathead screwdriver.*\n\nIn Daghlian's case, he dropped one of the bricks on top of the core, causing a criticality event that released a lethal dose of radiation into his body, killing him a few days later.\n\nIn Slotin's case, the flathead screwdriver slipped from its position (Slotin had removed the protective spacers that had been placed there previously to prevent the two halves from fully closing), the spheres closed, and another criticality event occurred, irradiating Slotin and 7 other people around him. Slotin died a horrible death several days later, as well.",

The human body has all the parts, yet when one falls, the head is always protected even at the cost of losing hands.\n\nIf we go by the logic, no one can be the progenitor of anything. Everything is built upon BILLIONS of people working towards little things. Ferrari, a supercar, was built upon the wheels cavemen invented. Thomas Edison used the inert gas someone else discovered. \n\nThe head of something is one who brings it all together. One who is bold enough to \"take that leap of faith\". \n\nI haven't watched Oppenheimer, but I'm sure there were instances/dilemmas where he took some important decisions that eventually saved the day.

Some forms of ionizing radiation are strong enough to penetrate flesh and trigger a photoreceptor, causing a flash of light to be observed. Astronauts on the ISS (also exposed to more direct high energy radiation) have reported perceiving flashes even while their eyelids are closed.\n\nIn some visual diseases causing blindness, young kids may even rub their eyes really hard because small flashes may be given off by this action and it satisfies an almost primal desire of the brain for some sort of visual input. They have to be dissuaded from doing this, as it can cause other problems on the front of their eyes. \n\nIn any case, hard to know exactly what this girl saw, but interesting to speculate nonetheless.",

Three Hungarian physicists (Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller [future father of the H bomb]) came to Einstein, since he was such a famous and respected scientist, and told him of what they had learned about Germany\u2019s interest in experiments into nuclear fission. Szilard and Einstein crafted the letter to FDR, although the Manhattan project didn\u2019t commence until a couple of years later. \n\nIncidentally, another piece of trivia is that Richard Feynman claimed he was the only person to directly view this first test.

He is credited with the famous mass to energy conversion ratio e=mc2. This doesn\u2019t tell one how to convert it, but it says it\u2019s possible.

That fighter was Arjuna, an archer(?) and the enemy had a lot of his family and friends he would undoubtedly need to kill in the war.\nKrishna convinces him and turns into his warrior form. He then says the \"I am death\" line. It's also implied that Vishnu said there will be no retreat and grew into an even scarier god. Krishna is depicted as handsome(and blue), and romantic.\n\nThis is oversimplified, but looks like Oppenheimer finally accepted that he and his collaborators, the physicists, all others involved, would kill a lot of people. When he saw that first explosion, there was no doubt left. The Hindu philosophy is difficult but reminds me of other religions in it's emphasis on faith, divine forgiveness, being a faithful \"warrior\" and death being impermanent. Oppenheimer did not absolve himself and died quite young.\n\n\nDropping the A- bomb was a very late action by the USA. \nAccording to reliable sources, someone important spared Kyoto because he honeymooned there and it was beautiful.(The War Secy, Stimson).",

And since Nolan likes his films sharp they are generally pretty consistent when it comes to the resolution. \n\nWhat is arguably more important is the color depth, digital scanning and projection caps out at 12bits, which is a lot, however imax estimates their film stock could be scanned out at 24 or 28 bits if the technology were available.\nThis means a film print will be showing a much greater range of color then any DCP can.\n\nIn general the variation in resolution and bit depth is not as noticeable as digital because of the organic nature of film. So our eyes generally read it as more natural.\n\nThis is all assuming someone is watching projected in 15 perf 70mm film print. Where the benefits are most apparent. I was fortunate enough to see Dunkirk on a 15 perf film print and a 5 perf regular 70mm film print. And besides the smaller framing the resolution difference was noticeable.

        "I ain't complaining",
        "They did. And while the movie was good, (it wasnt great like i hoped), the music was awesome.",
        "It\u2019s honestly where I know him from LOL also because of Ludwig and Childish Gambino stuff",
        "\"Greendale is where I belong\" is such a relaxing listen, I love it",
        "Community was an all-star team, in front and behind the camera. From Harmon (now doing Rick and Morty), the Russo Brothers, Justin Lin, Ludwig, to Glover, and the rest of the cast, all doing interesting stuff all around. Hell, even the fucking dean has an Oscar.",
        "I think he did new girl as well. Very weird seeing his name pop up during rewatches.",
        "He also did Bad Trip lol.",
        "Funnily enough it worked out great for both films - Goransson\u2019s score for Tenet was so propulsive and interesting and industrial, and Zimmer nailed this incredible otherworldly feel for Dune that completely fit the massive scope of the story.",
        "Wally Pfister is still in the industry and making good money too: http://www.resetcontent.com/wally-pfister\n\nJust because he makes commercials doesn't mean he isn't actively working. And it's related work - Ridley Scott still does it through his company Ridley Scott Associates.",
        "I hope they get together once again. They were a masterful duo.",
        "one day i saw a child playing with a uranium sphere the size of a tangerine",
        "Jesse what the fuck are you talking about",
        "Michael Caine and Anthony Hopkins are two celebrity deaths I don't ever want to read about.",
        "You missed the Tangerine",
        "That was good, with Jason Statham",
        ">Guy Ritchie's Wrath of Man\n\nProbably my least favorite Ritchie film; felt like he was trying to ape the tone of Sicario. Not a fan of the dialogue either. Pretty much none of the wit that I expected from his writing. A competently done action flick, but that's it. Holt McCallany was probably the best part.",
        "He's also in the Guy Ritchie movie that is coming out this year.",
        "Penny Dreadful wasn't unheard of. Not a movie but enough that he didn't dissappear.",
        "Man Bunraku was great.",
        "Loved him in Bunraku",
        "That's right, forgot about that",
        "He's very versatile. He can do comedy, he can do drama. He worked with the Coen Brothers by making a brief appearance in \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\" He was on HBO with \"The Plot Against America.\" He gets a lot of work. He's not just the guy snorting cocaine in Superbad, lol.",
        "If it was released in december instead of may it probably wouldnt have been hit as hard, it was just way too soon after TLJ.",
        "\u201cThanks!\u201d - bum in Batman Begins",
        "What really? That's what happened ?",
        "I'm guessing I've told you about my condition.",
        "He's not really a professional historian and isn't 100% accurate all the time but he is at least honest about his own biases when they come up and does his best to give a complete version of history. I really love his shows.",
        "Basically Nolan will get 20% of every ticket sale starting from the film's release date continuing for whatever time the contract says. He will get the 20% regardless if the film turns a profit or not, so the likelihood of \"Hollywood accounting\" screwing him over is minimised. Not that I think any studio would dare to screw Nolan over.\n\n20% first dollar gross is a deal that only people with MASSIVE star power like Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime can get.",
        "Fuck it, we'll do it live",
        "Honestly if he was like a decade older, Pattinson would\u2019ve been a great option for Oppenheimer. But honestly this role was practically MADE for Cillian Murphy",
        "Absolutely one my favourite actors working today. Cant wait for the Batman! I\u2019m watching Batman returns right now lol",
        "He definitely looks more similar with this comparison but I didn\u2019t see it in the picture posted.",
        "If you're Nolan you can probably get Kodak to crank out a batch of whatever. Plus putting B&W emulsion on 65mm stock is a fairly straightforward request, assuming the 35mm isn't cut down and perfed from a wider bulk reel already. He probably could shoot the whole thing on 65mm Kodachrome if he really wanted to flex, lol.",
        "65mm is the same as 120 film of which Kodak makes plenty of Black and White film types. All you need is to add perforations to it.",
        "It must leave you enraged, when you compare our talents.\n\nBecause in this battle, there is no balance.",
        "See also deciding the guards need to know about the hole in the compound fence, and then (very scientifically!) wondering how long it would take them to notice he was only ever going past them in one direction...",
        "One of the funniest parts of that was when he visited another facility and did the same shit and notified the leadership of how easy it was to get in to their filing systems, they didn't implement the measures he recommended, they just told everyone not to let Feynman in their offices lol",
        "IT HIS WEDDING DAY YA FOOKIN KNOW!",
        "Props. Instead of tobacco they used blends of herbs so the actors can \u201csmoke\u201d but not get lung cancer etc.",
        "In my book it does. Don\u2019t think he smokes in Sunshine tho",

        "It shows you what the star of a movie called Oppenheimer about J Robert Oppenheimer will look like as J Robert Oppenheimer. That\u2019s really all there is to know about the product. \u201cThis is a movie about a guy. Here\u2019s the guy the movie is about.\u201d That\u2019s the whole sell.\n\nAnd considering Cillian Murphy and the movie have been trending today on socials and people are engaging with it online (including you), it\u2019s done it\u2019s job, no? If it annoys you you could just not engage with it, because building hype and getting people to discuss a dude\u2019s face a year and a half before the movie in which it appears comes out (like we\u2019re doing right now) is literally the job of a marketing department and they\u2019re doing it well and we\u2019re participating so they probably won\u2019t change strategies any time soon.\n\nEdit:\n> It's a commercial that mentions the product name, but really doesn't tell you what the product does.  Should one become excited over that?\n\nAlso, this sub is quite flip-floppy over what marketing is too much and what\u2019s not enough. People always complain that trailers spoil too much and that marketing should just convey tone, but other times a [B&W recreation of the central famous historical figure](https://imgur.com/HxjESKx) is apparently useless about indicating what this film will be.",
        ">Should one become excited over that?\n\nSure, why not? It seems that people like Cillian Murphy and want to discuss him and the rest of the cast. People like speculating.",
        "First Look at \"Movie\". And it's just a picture of the actors and nothing special. Front Page. 20k upvotes.",
        "Ultra-wide lens up close will do this. Also, it makes your nose look bigger. I'm guessing anywhere from 12mm-24mm basically touching the lens.",

        "Completely agree.  Everyone came out a winner here.",

        "Yes, he forgot that his wife was strapped to the atomic bomb as it detonated in Hiroshima. He was a very forgetful man, and the movie will explore that through a very complex narrative structure.",

        "Sunshine was a fucking awesome movie and doesn't get the praise it deserves.",
        "It\u2019s just the default tone of Reddit. \n\nThese aren\u2019t actual problems, it\u2019s just most people here can only speak in a contrarian voice. \n\nComplaining is the lowest common denominator of relatability, which in turn makes upvotes, and so Reddit intrinsically encourages that kind of speaking voice with its voting system.\n\nIt is insufferable, seems to have gotten worse recently, but unfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of alternatives for these sorts of communities.\n\nPersonally I think ignoring it is best. If you debunk every opinion like that, you\u2019ll spend all day at it and get nothing in return.",

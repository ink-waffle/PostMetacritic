No one person built the nuclear bomb, and calling a man like Oppenheimer its \u201cmastermind\u201d is unfair both to him and the many others who worked with him.",
        "Documentaries seldom explain that perhaps the hardest part of building the first fission bombs was the timing of the detonations of conventional explosives which forced the fissionable material into a critical mass that would explode rather than just heat up and melt.\n\nElectrical current takes measurable time to travel over wires to \"blasting caps\" and all of the explosions had to happen at exactly the same instant so that the force compressing the fissile material was applied evenly in three dimensions.  Today there are off the shelf timer switches capable of that precision.  The Manhattan Project had to invent them and had nothing more sophisticated than ~~slide rules~~ rudimentary early computers and analog gauges to assess and model their performance.

Today there are off the shelf timer switches capable of that precision.  The Manhattan Project had to invent them and had nothing more sophisticated than ~~slide rules~~ rudimentary early computers and analog gauges to assess and model their performance.

Slotin died a horrible death several days later, as well.",

If the blackout is brief enough that we don't have to close, then there's only so far we can set back those movies once the power comes back on. If it drags on too long, then we have to start canceling shows and eventually close down and have guests leave the building for the sake of safety. This is usually determined by the battery life of our emergency lighting and whether or not we know if the power will come back on before they die. I'm actually kinda surprised you were allowed to stay in the auditorium with the power out for that long.\n\nOftentimes, even a quick flicker or brownout can set us back by a good 20+ minutes, as we have to go to each projector and get them back up, one by one. This doesn't even factor in the occasional technical issues that commonly occur from power failures. Given that most showtimes only have roughly half an hour gap between them, that leaves very little time to clean and set up for the next show. To add to this, the movie schedule on each projector is largely automated. Yes, we have a little room to make adjustments, but we can't allow a movie to run over the next scheduled showtime.\n\nIf the next showing of Oppenheimer was late because the prior show ran too long, then all the guests waiting for the next show would be inconvenienced in addition to those who were already affected by the blackout. You'd basically be causing *more* problems by trying to lessen the severity of the initial problem.\n\nIt's *much* easier and far faster to simply hand out passes (usually *with* refunds) and try to salvage the remaining showtimes, which are likely just as busy as the ones that got interrupted or canceled. It also reduces the spread of how many guests are affected by the issue, which I feel may be the primary factor involved here."

Somehow, this kind of spin makes them money. Is it the ratings? Something else?\n\nI feel like there is an intent to misattribute blame in order to *perpetuate* these tragedies.\n\nHere's what's to blame:\n\n1. Not taking children's mental health seriously. Doesn't matter if it's a phase or not--if a child seems depressed, obsessed, or whatever *get them to a counselor* and *find out what is wrong*. Could be bullying no one noticed, could be a bad breakup, could be a genetic disposition to chemical imbalance--*find out*, and help these children deal with it. In this case, it sounds like action was taken far too late; it's a good bet that earlier signs of trouble were ignored.\n\n2. Schools ignoring the social structure students set up for themselves. There should be active efforts to integrate cliques, to ensure that students are not excluded or insulated, and to deescalate interpersonal conflicts so they do not become grudges. I haven't seen any reporting on this boy's social situation yet, but I'll bet it had something to do with his choices.\n\n3. Parents who should not own guns or have children. If you can't keep your gun out of your child's hands you must lose the right to posses guns. If you are unaware that your child is playing with guns, you must lose your right to posses children. Maybe you get a chance to earn both back later, but you need to prove to a court that you are competent to care for the safety of your child and competent to handle a firearm. I think some people are tempted to make this the primary target of blame, because they need a simple thing to blame, but there are a lot of things parents *don't* control or know about their kids, especially after puberty--in this case, however, they need to go to jail as well.",

Robert Oppenheimer accepted the position of director in 1947. Under Oppenheimer's leadership, the institute became a leading center for theoretical physics. Albert Einstein had been a scholar-in-residence at the institute since 1933, after fleeing Nazi Germany and renouncing his German citizenship. Einstein transformed the world of physics with his theory of relativity and work in quantum mechanics. On the basis of Einstein's recommendation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened a board to investigate the possibilities of using a nuclear chain reaction as an atom bomb. Oppenheimer directed the Manhattan Project, which developed and detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert outside of Alamogordo, New Mexico.",

After the weapon was assured he urged the US government to tell the world to prevent a secretive arms race. And he was absolutely correct, the USSR and USA raced to build bigger and more destructive bombs which threatened to end humanity.

Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer. Oscar\u00ae winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \n>Academy Award\u00ae nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \n>Oppenheimer also stars Oscar\u00ae winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar\u00ae nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n\n>The cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \n>The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment\u2019s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\n>Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX\u00ae 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX\u00ae black and white analogue photography. \n\n>Nolan\u2019s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations.",

He okayed the plan, but the order was given by the person who was normally in charge of bombing raids in the Asian theatre. \n\nIn the aftermath of the bombs landing, there\u2019s been a massive revision of who knew what when. There was a film that came out about the bombs, and in that film there\u2019s a scene where Truman is seen contemplating deeply about dropping the nukes on Japan.

There may have been a debate about which cities to drop the bomb on by a committee, which involved the team developing the nukes, but that\u2019s about it.

He's too curious to stop, while at the same time he knows this is going the wrong way. There's a certain amount of him that's too curious that he simply puts a world's life on a knife's edge.

Many people have speculated that Heisenberg intentionally sabotaged the program which lead to it's failure and paint him as as more of a hero and less... You know... A nazi.\n\nWith that in mind, I feel like Galen Erso was perhaps inspired by Heisenberg.

The issue was, and still is a problem for Japan, that there are very little open spaces or \u201cnew\u201d land to develop in Japan for new military sites. Have you visited Nellis AFB?  The only reason Vegas exists is because it was built \u201cafter\u201d Nellis. Most US sites were built in WWII were made in wide open spaces. So\u2026Since, they knew there would be collateral damage, no matter how hard they would try to avoid population centers near military targets, the US AAF would still kill civilians. So\u2026, they adopted fire bombing. \n\nCan it be argued as war crimes? You bet, especially with today\u2019s lenses. The A-Bomb however, kind of made the argument a side show compared to the shock of an atomic bomb being used (on pop. centers as well). In total, the firebombing killed ~350,000 over a much longer course of time, whereas the two atom bombs killed ~250-300,000, but in only two separate days. Likely, the predictions said by ending the war with the atomic bombs, the US military likely saved 400,000 (a low estimate by some, but we\u2019ll never know). \n\nThese are just numbers. I\u2019m not arguing the morale argument of killing hundreds of thousands of your enemy\u2019s humans, to save hundreds of thousands of your own military\u2019s lives.

The firebombing actually only tried to target the areas of the city where the greatest concentration was, not destroy the entire city. \n\nThe American part of the CBO in Europe was probably the most precise attempt by anyone. It was hugely successful and basicalyl obliterated the luftwaffe, substantially hindered German industry in general, and utterly annhilated Germanies oil supply in the second half of 1944. \n\nRegarding the nukes, they were simply the best way to to induce a sort of \"shock effect\" to get the Japanese to surrender. Otherwise the only way forward was to invade the island and let them throw their entire 31 million person population at the invasion. \n\nAnd lastly, but I need to address the entire pretentious nature of the logic from the OP. \n\n\\-World War Two was a total war. This is pretty much always the case in varying degrees once two nation states totally mobilize for war. What nobody seems to consider when they get upset over civilian deaths in pursuit of military objectives is what the cost was of every day the war continued. Using the United States as an example, which was hardly the most casualty laden combatant, the average US Infantry company after D-Day took ONE HUNDRED PERCENT casualties every 3 months. This doesnt mean the entire original cadre died, but it gives some idea of what you are asking of your troops, which are are necessarily DRAFTING to fight the war. EVERY DAY that the war goes on, you are essentially getting one step closer to genociding your entire population as you feed them to the meat grinder. INTENTIONAL civilian deaths in pursuit of proportional military aims are ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED under these circumstances. \n\nAnd one more thing. This is legal under the law of war. Its call proportionality and falls under the \"doctrine of double effect\". FORSEEN AND DELIBERATE killing of civilians is LEGAL AND MORAL when it is done in pursuit of destroying a proportional military objective."

But on seeing his cousins, uncles, family ranged against him, Arjuna breaks down and asks Krishna, the avatar of God, \"How can you justify war, the killing, and even slaying your own relatives\". Krishna's response is the [Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita), the most famous of Hindu scriptures\n\n**The Line** \n\n> I am Time (Kaal), the destroyer of all worlds.\n\n> ([Ch 11 Verse 32](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/11/verse/32)) \"kalo'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\" meaning \"He is all powerful time (kaal as in kalo), destroyer of all the worlds.\"\n\nThe argument is that Time has already seen/consumed/accomplished the death of all Arjuna's opponents on the battlefield without Arjuna having picked up a single weapon. So you (Arjuna) might as well fight these opponents, as they are already slain by Me (God/Time)\n\n**The inferences/discussion** courtesy also /u/Tifud\n\n1. Krishna is telling Arjuna not wuss out, to do his job, his duty, but *whether he does or not*, all those assembled are already dead. And he will be judged accordingly. He is just Krishna's instrument, wonderfully skilled.\n\nIt's a bit of mindf** touching upon free will, the hindu concept of karma and dharma (duty, right/good, merit) etc\n\n2. At the same time, at the end of the entire bhagavad gita, after Krishna has literally pulled God on Arjuna, he says \"Do as you will\"\n\n3. So one interpretation is do as you judge best, act not for your [gain](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/47) alone and I will decide and judge you..\n\n4. Another interpretation is that God pulls a thousand strings to effect his goal, yet stands by the side as companion leaving it to man (Arjuna) to actually do the deeds.\n\nThe paradox of evil in a world with an all powerful and good god is neatly sidestepped\n\n**A brief discussion of what it might have meant for Oppenheimer** - from [Alex Wellerstein](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/05/23/oppenheimer-gita) /u/restricteddata. Credit also Prof Hijiya\n\n> Rather, it is him being awed by what is being displayed in front of him, confronted with the spectacle of death itself unveiled in front of him, .... and realizing how little and inconsequential he is as a result. *Compelled by something cosmic and terrifying, Oppenheimer then reconciles himself to his duty as a prince of physics, and that duty is war.*\n\nBonus Edit : Oppenheimer also [thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer#Trinity) of [another line](http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-11-11.html) from the Gita when he saw the Trinity fireball\n\n> If the **radiance of a thousand suns** were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one\n\n------\n\nLate Bonus Edit 2: **a good discussion of the grammar of 'I am become' vs 'I have become'** via  /u/mercurialohearn, /u/yakrider07,  and other excellent folks at  [Askhistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ny2sl/what_is_the_significance_of_the_use_of_i_am/)   - as a correct, if archaic form of English also encountered elsewhere such as in the bible, in carols, in other phrases . It is due to English's Germanic influence/roots. It also could be simply a poetic translation.\n\n/u/koine_lingua also provides examples of more modern translations of the Gita eg\n>\"I am time grown old, creating world destruction\u201d (Miller) or \u201ctime . . . grown mature\u201d (Radhakrishnan). These are superficially similar to Oppenheimer's \"become death\" (in the sense that they seem to both be verbs usually used for a process). ...[Similarly] \"I am time, mighty wreaker of the world's destruction\"",

        "He first said that in 1965. That's a long time to come up with something to say....",
        "Not to split hairs but he didn\u2019t turn to Hinduism in his later years. Oppenheimer was a well read student and had made his way through Indian and Hindu texts in earlier college studies. He was quite the intellectual through all of his life and did not \u201cturn\u201d to Hinduism in his later years. \n\nSource: the book \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J.

He was not much of anything, religiously \u2014 he was born into a fairly secular Jewish family, embraced the Ethical Culture of Felix Adler and [saw philosophy as a boon to his soul; enjoying the ideas of the Gita but was not religious about it]",

        "He also tried to poison a teacher he didn\u2019t like.  Really bright people are often a little obviously unbalanced and no more morally wise than actors or athletes.   There has never been such a peaceful transfer of power as the second half of the twentieth century to when the old colonial powers withdrew and the new ones took over.  The cold war was bloody, but nothing compared to the rest of human history.  The overwhelming slaughter was from states killing directly or through neglect, their own citizens.  One of things that gets missed in popular history is the reality of demographics.  There are now five times as many people sharing the planet as when Oppenheimer was born.   The fact that there aren\u2019t wars involving billions of people, is pretty amazing.  I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t happen, Russia and China both seem to currently have expansionist colonial ambitions and there are vast population pressures in places without the agriculture to support them, but so far so good.  Oppenheimer died in 1967.  I think he would be overall very pleasantly surprised by the state of the world today.",

A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita.

He and JFK were rarely seen without the other before JFK ran for office.\n- I always found it weird that JFK and Robert Kennedy, who were very close and told each other everything, would somehow or for some reason have the same mistress (Monroe).

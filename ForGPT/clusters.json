So, the default focal length on the iphone is the 35m equivalent of 24mm, I believe. It's a rather WIDE focal length as your default and that sort of wide lens is not often used. A lot of photographers go to 1,2 and that translates to 28mm, a much more used focal length. 1,4 is about 35mm, which is really used much more. Right now, you have to fiddle with the slider manually every single time to get to those more common focal lengths. These presets are trying to solve that.", "I'm usually not a big apple / iPhone fan, however I like photography, and i gotta say that i like the feature of being able to have 24-28-35 mm options, since those are pretty standard focal lengths. I think that 24mm being so wide is part of what makes average phone photography worse, because a lot of people point and shoot with this very wide angle, which usually includes way more than needed in their shot, making photos messy due to bad compositions. \n\nIf i had one, I'd probably default to 35 or 28mm, and switch to 24 mostly for landscapes and such", "In classic photography (think for example Leica lenses) 24, 28, and 35mm are the most common focal distances.
